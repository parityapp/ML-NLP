<SachaS> reinhard: you saw the abstraction of my diagram ... another abstraction level will be added :) one on top of the bus. its no longer simply publish/subscribe but its a business process on top of publish/subscribe.
<SachaS> there is a collaborative business process handled in the ebXML software
<SachaS> there is a business business process handled in the business application (gnue appserver app with a possibly public procedure which uses business classes and their procedures)
<SachaS> but then there is a new business process
<SachaS> a business process describing how applications interact with each other, this might be called a integration business process.
<derek> <btami> derek have to read that :)
<derek> im not sure what that is about
<derek> for the record i am probably one of the few here that has made a commerical application that actually used a purely object database
<derek> so telling me to look at the advantages of objects is silly
<derek> you act as if i dont know what objects are
<derek> or don't understand they can be valuable
<derek> i will argue teh OTHER way
<derek> what REAL experience do you have on an enterprise level with object data storage?
<derek> i can state i built and maintained commercial ERP software for major law firms using object database technology
<derek> so i know some of the real advantages and real pitfalls
<derek> not "book" knowledge, but real practical implementation
<derek> for the record http://www.omegalegal.com/ is the software i am talking about

<derek> jcater or jamest
<derek> is there a way to force focus on an entry?
<jcater> jamest
<derek> in GFEntry
<jcater> what did I win?
<derek> i dont see in triggers or properties to set such a thing
<derek> basically looking for something like
<jcater> I think it's just
<jcater> setFocus(entryName)
<derek> blk.entry.setFocus
<jcater> or form.setFocus(entryName)
<derek> hmm okay
<derek> ah so its probably in GFForm
<derek> yip GFForm
<derek> GFForm.py:    self._triggerFunctions = {'setFocus':{'function':self.tri
<derek> thanks was looking in wrong area
<derek> do we have a "tool" to whip through all the self._triggerFunctions
*** btami has joined #gnuenterprise
<derek> and print out documentation on that?
<derek> as seems like 40% of the questions the guys have here (and me too) is how do i do X
<jcater> no
<jcater> been thinking about that
<jcater> but haven't had a chance to do it
<derek> we are getting better at looking the source for trigger definitions
<jcater> have you looked in the Dev Guide?
<derek> no
<derek> well maybe
<derek> i had the guys pritn out something
<derek> but they complained it was missing a lot
<derek> might have been an old version
<derek> you have link to most current?
<jcater> it is missing a lot
<derek> i will download and print
<jcater> but it's also 76 pages

<derek> one thing we want to do is hep document
<jcater> the stuff that is there is pretty complete and up-to-date
<jcater> Appendix C is what you want
* jcater may try to spend a few minutes today updating that

<btami> <derek> <btami> derek have to read that :)

<btami> http://www.ambysoft.com/persistenceLayer.pdf
<btami> jcater: hav you got a little time today?
<btami> <jcater> well, I don't have time to give my opinion
<btami> <jcater> but I have a strong opinion about all of this
<jcater> probably not
<btami> :(
* jcater is about 2 weeks behind schedule on my current project
<derek> btami: this guy explains exactly my PROBLEMS with the approach
<derek> There is an impedance mismatch between the object and relational paradigms, and this mismatch leads object and data practitioners to different designs.
<derek> basically he argues build all the classes and such and make the database structure to mimic those
<derek> i.e. lose all the power of the relational database storage system you are using
<derek> he tries to pass this off as "anyone that is not pro object is an idiot and they need to change how they think"
<derek> if they understood objects they would design their databases to mimic them
<derek> when in fact peopel that understand what relational design was designed to solve take advantage of it
<derek> and really do not want to restrucutre their data to be stored like objects as they lose the features they inherently built in to take advantage of teh system
<derek> clearly if one wants to say "build your classes and make your storage match"
<derek> why bother using relational database system?
<derek> save the headache and use an object or hierarchial storage system
<derek> that has an "odbc" driver that allows you to map your classes to sql tables for other applications to "read" the data
<derek> i do think mapping can (and should exist) that in my opinion is WHAT appserver should be doing
<derek> i do not think we should be making whacked schemas to match classes
<derek> that is my opinion (and like standards that great thing about opinions are there are so many to choose from)
<btami> derek: maybe you are reading another article :)
<btami> i can't read nowhere
<btami> he tries to pass this off as "anyone that is not pro object is an idiot and they need to change how they think"
<btami> as i understand, these papers all about how to use OO languages/design _with_ rdbms
<btami> and Python is an OO language...
<btami> our DBSIG2 abstraction is a mapping too
<btami> appserver is another one
<btami> just enhanced with procedures
<btami> maybe i'm wrong
*** bluesbaron_ has left #gnuenterprise
*** Amorphous has quit IRC
* btami thinks derek have to read the gnue-appserver/doc/whitepaper.txt again
<derek> btami my point is he says CLEARLY
<derek> dont use traditional relational structures 
<derek> they are bad
<derek> make them match you classes
<derek> http://www.agiledata.org/essays/drivingForces.html
<derek> he starts by attackign that relational databases are all most always poorly designed
<derek> "First, your legacy database design likely has some significant problems."
<derek> then he adds even if it is not designed badly it still wont work
<derek> "Second, even if the existing database design is very good there can be significant differences in the way that you map objects to relational databases."
<derek> im all for mapping and i think site actually has some good points
<derek> and is valuable
<derek> however on the whole they advocate losing relational functionality in favor of making the mapping easier
<derek> as evidence by the line i just pasted
<derek> "even if the relational design is good"
<derek> "it might not be good because it doesnt map well to objects"
<derek> that is how i read it
<derek> and the previous two times we have written appserver
<derek> this has proven to be the case
<derek> objects get discussed
<derek> then we start going down the class path (no pun intended)
<derek> at which point in time we decide to map to relational tables
<derek> and soon it turns into extending the relational tables to account for object needs
<derek> then it turns into altering relational tables completely to make mappings easier
<btami> derek: stop
<derek> and then it turns into the "drivers" for forms don't work well anymore
<btami> have you read whitepaper.txt ?
<derek> and then the people doing the work on appserver get pissed off an leave because they really want an object database and it just took them a while to realize
<derek> it
<btami> is it good or bad for your needs?
<derek> btami: im expressing the pattern not saying that is the goal
<derek> it is good.. i like the ideas in the whitepaper (if it is the same one i read many moons ago)
<derek> my point being you are pointing me to a site say
<derek> ing
<derek> "read this and then you will be enlightened"
<derek> and im saying
<btami> i'v never sait this !!!
<derek> "what you want me to be enlightened on is exactly what has killed appserver development in the past"
<btami> i know nothing the old appserver
<derek> <btami> derek have to read that :)
<btami> i'm trying to use the new :)
<derek> so you didn't want me to read it to be enlightened?
<derek> im not asking you to use the old
<btami> no, just read :)
<derek> im saying "don't forget history"
<derek> it has a way of repeating itself
<btami> if you agree on the whitepaper, what is you against with the current implementation?
<btami> i think it fallows the whitepaper
<derek> im not against the current implementation
<derek> someone is telling you lies if they have said such a thing
<derek> this conversation started out of the "gcd" discussion
<derek> i simply asked "why" a gcd
<derek> and how does the gcd replace and/or compliment the gsd
<derek> is a gcd necessary
<btami> hmm
<btami> i think yes
<derek> and instantly i was attacked as "not understanding objects" and "hating the appserver"
<derek> the discussion on gcd's had me worried we were ditching sound relational structures in favor of makign structures that were "easy to map"
<derek> i merely raised the flag to be cautious
<derek> and now somehow "i hate appserver"
<btami> ok
<derek> apparently you can't question anything here or you hate the product?
<btami> i think the .gcd problem is
<derek> as much as i give jamest and jcater crap about forms.. (read old logs with me telling them i hate blocks)
<btami> what format will be used for formalise gnue-packages?
*** uruboro has joined #gnuenterprise
<derek> you would be astonished that im trying like hell to get forms used a major setting
<derek> for a major application
<derek> point: there has to be open discussion with out getting personally offended
<derek> because i question the validity of something doesnt mean its the wrong thing (i.e. i have come to actually like blocks some now that they are being used (when i couldnt see their use initially))
<btami> sure
<derek> and because someone asks questions doesnt mean they dont like the product
<derek> you will have to excuse my frustration
<btami> ok
<reinhard> * derek is pretty adamantly against "objects"
<reinhard> <derek> i want an app server
<reinhard> <derek> not an object server
<reinhard> <derek> there has been much debate (and likely at some point either this project or appserver will fork over this issue)
<reinhard> this is what you said btw
<derek> but i kind of feel like you, kilo and reinhard have turned this into a personal attack
<derek> that i hate appserver
<derek> and as you just pasted
<derek> i WANT appserver
<derek> and yes have "concerns" about objects
<reinhard> just to remind you
<derek> but not remember we are using the term object in different ways
<reinhard> btami has asked you what you think of gcds
<reinhard> and you answered that likely "appserver or this project will fork"
<reinhard> note that appserver is not part of this projects
<reinhard> project
<reinhard> it's appserver on the one side and "this project" on the other side
<derek> the comment about the fork is that once already a fork has occured over this issue
*** wendall911 has joined #gnuenterprise
* reinhard will shut up again now
<derek> reinhard: my point on the fork is that either gnue could end up with 2 appservers if there is fundamental disagreement
<derek> or if someone didnt like forms being relational.. they could fork the project as a whole
* derek did not say this would happen or that it was desired to happen in fact it would be nice to be avoided at all costs
<derek> just pointed out that it could likely happen if the debate is intense as it has happened once
<derek> example....
<derek> treshna and bond-db
<derek> http://freshmeat.net/projects/bonddb/
<derek> i like the whitepaper and appserver very much
<derek> i am itching to be able to use it here
<derek> im not opposed to gcd's, but i think deciding on them will bring on great debate
<derek> i htink at some point we need to schedule an irc meeting to hash out how to handle class definitions and module packing
<derek> as btami has a very valid issue that its hard to make appserver packages without some strucutre like that
<btami> ok, just for log
<btami> i like all you guys :)
<btami> really
<derek> rofl
<derek> they probably don't have budweiser commericals in hungary, but...
<derek> "I love you man!"
<derek> followed by
<derek> "You aren't getting my bud light" 
<derek> would be an appropriate joke here 
<dhill1> half the audience gets the joke, the other half scratch their heads.
<SachaS> derek, have you tried (within last 3 months) the sample in appserver?
<btami> i like SachaS too :)
<SachaS> thanks btami
<SachaS> i like you too
<SachaS> haha

<dhill1> any network gurus here feeling charitable towards idiots today?
<dhill1> I'm an idiot seeking help...
<dhill1> I just got a linux box running last week and want to network it with my winXP box.  
<dhill1> I'm pretty sure I have all the required parts, but lack a clue how to configure it.
<SachaS> dhill1 are both machines connected to a switch or hub?
<dhill1> I have a hub I can use.  The linux box has 2 ethernet cards.
<SachaS> win and linux box connected?
<SachaS> physically?
<dhill1> Not yet.  My dsl line comes in to the win box. I was hoping to have the dsl go to the linux box, then connect the linux and win.
<dhill1> does that make any sense?
<SachaS> makes sense to me
<dhill1> So dsl connects to linux eth0
<dhill1> and linux eth1 to win
<dhill1> eth0 would use dhcp
<SachaS> linux eth1 goes to hub.
<SachaS> win ethernet goes to hub
<dhill1> ok
<SachaS> or if you have a crossover cable you can connect both straight with each other ...
<dhill1> probably don't have a crossover cable
<SachaS> ok.
<SachaS> so both into hub
<dhill1> ok
<dhill1> how do I set ip address for win box?
<dhill1> do I do something with netmask, gateway address, broadcast address?  Like I said, I'm clueless.
<SachaS> then you can give linux eth1 an ip like 192.168.1.1 with netmask 255.255.255.0
<SachaS> we try first to let both machines (linux and win) communicate
<SachaS> what linux distribution are you using?
<SachaS> depending on the distribution you have a tool that does it for you.
<dhill1> mepis
<SachaS> do you have a graphical tool to setup the network?
<SachaS> with that distribution?
<dhill1> yup.  looks pretty easy.
<dhill1> do I have to worry about gateway or broadcast?  One is 192.68.0.1, the other is 192.68.0.255
<SachaS> your linux box will be the gateway
<SachaS> so you will set whatever IP address you give your linux eth1 as gateway on your win machine.
<SachaS> linux eth1: 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
<SachaS> win: 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway: 192.168.1.1
<dhill1> It's that easy?  I'll need to go away for a few minutes to swap cables around.
<SachaS> ok.
